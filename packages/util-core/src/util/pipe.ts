import { pPipe } from './pipe-promise'

/**
 * Performs function composition in LTR (Left To Right) direction.
 *
 * Our `pipe` and  `pipe.promise` implementation supports N arguments. But you can use only 10 in
 * TypeScript, because it doesn't support **Variadic Kinds** and we explicitly
 * have to define the type of all the possible usages as method overloads.
 *
 * @example
 * const normalizeWhiteSpaces = text => name.replace(/\s+/g, ' ').trim();
 *
 * const getInitials = pipe(
 *   normalizeWhiteSpaces,
 *   name => name.split(' ').map(name => name.charAt(0)),
 *   initials => initials.join('').toLocaleUpperCase()
 * );
 *
 * getInitials('Vitor Luiz Cavalcanti');
 * //=> "VLC"
 *
 * @param fn - An arity N function. Its result is the argument of next one.
 * @param fns - Functions of arity 1. Each one's result is next's argument.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * const addUnicorn = async string => `${string} Unicorn`;
 * const addRainbow = async string => `${string} Rainbow`;
 *
 * const pipeline = pipe.promise(addUnicorn, addRainbow);
 *
 * console.log(await pipeline('❤️'));
 * //=> '❤️ Unicorn Rainbow'
 * @param ...input - Iterated over sequentially when returned `function` is called.
 * @returns The `input` functions are applied from left to right.
